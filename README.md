# This repo was an exercise in observing the relationship between typescript, javascript and testing

## Advantage of using TypeScript in programming 
### One of the most significant advantages of TypeScript is its support for static typing.
### TypeScript assists in type testing, because type-related issues are detected before the code is even executed, providing early feedback and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.
### Result - most testing of types is redundant if the codebase is typescript, as typescript enforces types "upstream" from the testing stage
### However comprehensive testing practices should still be in place to ensure the overall quality and reliability of your software.
